ALL OPERATIONS EXPECT INPUT TENSORS WITH A BATCH DIMENSION AT AXIS=0!!!!!!
SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS (1, 32, 16) OR (16, 32, 16) WITH EACH SAMPLE BEING OF SHAPE (32, 16)
4D INPUT IS ALSO POSSIBLE SO SOMETHING LIKE THIS (1, 3, 32, 32) THIS COULD BE ONE INPUT IMAGE OF SHAPE (3, 32, 32) WITH 3 CHANNELS AND 32 HEIGHT AND 32 WIDTH
COMPUTATION IS DONE ALONG THIS BATCH DIMENSION WHICH MEANS FOR EACH SAMPLE INDIVIDUALLY


DATA IS PROVIDED IN ONE AND ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FORMS, OTHERS ARE UNDEFINED:
1. 2D TENSOR: (batch_size, feature_dim)
2. 3D TENSOR: (batch_size, seq_length, element_dim)
3. 4D TENSOR: (batch_size, channel_dim, height, width)


OPERATIONS WORK IN FOLLOWING WAYS:
1. AXIS OPERATIONS (axis=[None,0,1,2,3], keepdims=[True,False])
2. BATCH OPERATIONS (e.g. batched matmul)
