## Broader Impacts and Inclusivity

### Broader Impacts
Virtually all machine learning and AI algorithms can be attributed to solving optimization problems during the training process. While automatic differentiation does not direct broader impacts, its extensive use as an intermediate step in these algorithms forces us to consider the broader impact of our package. First of all, our package will be contributing to biases against African-American and other underrepresented minorities that current ML models used in the criminal justice system or hiring processes are already imposing. Second, any errors in our calculations could lead to misspecified models and erroneous predictions with significant impacts to downstream users. These impacts are especially grave in safety-critical settings such as healthcare, where a model that utilizes a faulty AD library could misdiagnose a patient or suggest sub-optimal treatments.
